## A graphical approach to to-do lists

This project is a very early work in progress and concept of a graphical approach to to-do lists. Instead of creating lists with different indentations or tabs for each project, the goal is to have your to-do's in one place, on a graphical plane. 
The sorting and assignments are all visual by having different "planets", circles with labels and descriptions, placed on the plane. Each planet can turn into a star when other planets are set to orbit the star.

Project could be set as a star and planets with the individual to-do's assigned to orbit around the star. Different orbits may present different priorities.

It is planned to be able to individually set alarms to each planet and add information like text, images or documents to each to-do planet.

## Is this going to be more productive than to-do lists?

I am not sure. Right now, a few basic functionalities are missing, e.g., saving to-dos. After these things work, i see this project as a concept. With the current design, it seems unlikely to yield any advantages over text-based solutions, but maybe that can be adjusted.

## Plans

- Make basic functionality work
- Save/Load "galaxies"
- Add more information to planets than labels
- Add due dates and reminders

## Installation

Download or clone this repository. Then download p5.js complete from https://p5js.org/download/ and place in a "js" subdirectory.

If you have Python installed, run webserver.bat on Windows or use any other webserver to parse the index.html file.
